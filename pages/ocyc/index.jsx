                Oxygen cycle, along with the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle
                plays an essential role in the existence of life on the earth.
                The oxygen cycle is a biological process which helps in
                maintaining the oxygen level by moving through three main
                spheres of the earth which are:
              </p>
              <ul className="text-lg">
                <li>Atmosphere</li>
                <li>Biosphere</li>
                <li>Lithosphere</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-lg">
                This biogeochemical cycle explains the movement of oxygen gas
                within the atmosphere, the ecosystem, biosphere and the
                lithosphere. The oxygen cycle is interconnected with the carbon
                cycle.

                The atmosphere is the layer of gases presents above the earthâ€™s
                surface. The sum of Earthâ€™s ecosystems makes a biosphere.
                Lithosphere is the solid outer section along with the earthâ€™s
                crust and it is the largest reservoir of oxygen.

              The steps involved in the oxygen cycle are:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Stage-1:</b> All green plants during the process of
              photosynthesis, release oxygen back into the atmosphere as a
              by-product.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Stage-2: </b>All aerobic organisms use free oxygen for
              respiration.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Stage-3:</b> Animals exhale Carbon dioxide back into the
              atmosphere which is again used by the plants during
              photosynthesis. Now oxygen is balanced within the atmosphere.
