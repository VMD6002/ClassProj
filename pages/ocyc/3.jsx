                Photosynthesis is a biological process by which all green plants
                synthesize their food in the presence of sunlight. During
                photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water, carbon dioxide to
                create energy, and oxygen gas is liberated as a by-product of
                this process.

The dead organism decays and the organic matter with carbon, oxygen, water, and other components are returned into the soil and air. This process is carried out by decomposers like invertebrates (fungi, bacteria, and some insects. The entire process consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.`}
